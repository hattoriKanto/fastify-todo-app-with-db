# Todo App Backend

Welcome to the Todo App Backend repository! This project serves as the backend for the Todo App (the link to the frontend repo is down below), providing a robust and efficient API to manage tasks. The backend is designed to be fast, scalable, and maintainable.

## Backend technologies that were used:
- **Fastify**: serves as the web server framework, handling incoming HTTP requests, routing, and serving responses.
- **Prisma ORM**: acts as the bridge between the application code and the database.
- **Typescript**: adds type safety and helps catch errors early in development.

## Database that was used: 
- **PostgreSQL**: the relational database stores the application's data.
